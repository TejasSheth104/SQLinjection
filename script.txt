Good Morning, 
Today my group [- - - ] and I will be presenting to you our final year project titled "Detection of SQL Injection Attack using reinforcement Learning" under the guidance of Ramya Maam.

Our problem statement aims at detecting SQL injection to improve security of the website. We have implemented a Reinforcemnet Model to detect malicious queries, as it is a self-learning model that learns from its environment and agents and helps in detecting latest vulnerabilities.

The primary objectives of our project is to create a basic web application to perform SQLinjection attacks, and to create a RL model to detect these attacks.

The scope of this project revolves around testing and security of a web application software with encompasses databases.
Previous methods utilized supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. 

The proposed system > take user input > parse the input > pass it to the ML model > display the output on user interface.

This is our frontend, 
We have used html css js and Flask to build our user interface and backend connectivity resp.
We input possible vulnerable query through input field.
teh Detect button sends a POST method to the backend, along with the input query and the corresponding result is displayed.

we have even submitted a resesarch/ review paper on the same pending acceptance.

Improve Accuracy.
